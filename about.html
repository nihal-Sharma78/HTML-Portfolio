<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>" My name is Khushi Sharma. I'm a web developer, bringing my creative vision to life through code. 
  I'm passionate about my front-end design, back-end functionality, or building user-friendly interfaces.
  I'm always looking for new challenges and excited to see what I can build next!""As a girl in web
  development, I love using code to turn ideas into reality. Whether it's building a visually stunning
   website or crafting a user experience that's smooth and intuitive, I find the process both creative 
   and rewarding. I'm excited to be part of a growing community of women in tech and to keep pushing 
   the boundaries of what's possible on the web."</p>

<p>I'm a girl who's fascinated by the power of web development.  Ever since I saw a website that used
  code to create beautiful animations, I knew I wanted to get involved. Now, I'm honing my skills in 
  HTML, CSS, and Javascript, focusing on crafting user-friendly interfaces.  I'm currently working on 
  a personal project that will be a fun and interactive learning platform for younger kids. I'm excited
   to use my skills to create something positive and engaging on the web.</p>

   <p>Web development requires a logical mind to tackle challenges and find solutions and "I'm a critical
    thinker who thrives on unraveling complex problems. This skill comes in handy when I'm building 
    websites and finding creative solutions for user needs." Web development isn't just about code; 
    it's about bringing ideas to life."I possess a creative spark and enjoy translating ideas into
    visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces." Learning to code takes dedication and the 
    ability to bounce back from setbacks. "I'm a persistent individual who isn't afraid of challenges.
    When faced with a coding hurdle, I enjoy the process ofdebugging and finding solutions."</p>
